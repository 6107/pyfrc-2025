# First Robotics Challenge 2025 - Team 6107    CyberJagzz

The code in this directory is based on the Java based competition code
for the CyberJagzz team. 2026 will be python based and by rewriting the
2025 code in Python, we hope to see some design patterns or at least
helper classes emerge to help us with the 2026 robotics challenge.

Currently, this code is working under the simulator and is currently
being tested on the 2025 robot (drivetrain only).
